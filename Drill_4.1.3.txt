1. Unsupervised methods in general do not compute Liklihoods or standard goodness metrics. This
would seem to indicate a need for a supervised statistical model only. ans. Supervised

2. This would indicate either PCA or clustering of some sort.  ans. Unsupervised methods.

3.  Identifying power users as it contains a goodness metric would appear to be an application of
of supervised methods.  The question is ambiguous enough to also probably work with clustering.
It would require a human to look at the clusters and define what a "Power User" was.
Final Answer: Both

4. classic unsupervised clustering on shopping variables. ans. unsupervised

5.  Sound like a PCA application.  ans. unsupervised.
